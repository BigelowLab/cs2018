# Bigelow Computer Science Intern 2019

## Applications due March 1!

## Overview
Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences, located in East Boothbay, Maine, seeks a summer intern with a strong background (coursework, experience, etc.) in computer science, interested in applying their skills to real-world, science-related problems.

*\* This is a living document and will be updated with changes and clarifications (both in-line and in the FAQ section).*

## Possible projects
- Contribute to a website/webapp for forecasting animal presence based on citizen science observations and climate (e.g. ticks, jellyfish, etc.)
- Create a website/webapp to organize, visualize, and distribute data collected from sensors all over Maine

## Other information
The Bigelow summer internship program offers students the opportunity to live in Boothbay and work in a dynamic, cutting-edge research environment. The program runs for 10 weeks from **May 28thâ€”August 2th**.

Interns will be provided with a **stipend** and **housing** (at our new [Residence Hall](https://www.bigelow.org/about/residence-hall.html)).

## How to apply

Please apple here: https://bigelow.freshteam.com/jobs/Cw4kyPPA1MlW/computer-science-intern-summer-2019

1. **Cover letter** (a brief statement describing why you would be an excellent fit for this internship)
2. **Resume**
3. Link to a **GitHub repo** with a project that you have worked on (if a group project, you must have contributed 40% or more of the code)
	- If you didn't use GitHub for the project, that's okay. Just create a new repository and add the code and instructions to execute.
    - This can be a school project, but should be something that you at least somewhat conceptualized and implemented on your own (e.g. not a step-by-step tutorial project).

## Application process

1. Submit application by Friday, **March 1**
2. Application review: March 4-6
3. Phone interviews for finalists: March 7-13
4. Final decision emails: by **March 15**

## FAQ
**Can international students with student/work visas apply?**  
*Absolutely!*

**Is this part of the REU program?**  
*No. Durring the summer, Bigelow hosts both [REU](https://www.bigelow.org/education/reu/) students and summer interns. There are activities that are mandatory for REU students, but not for interns. For example, REU students are required to complete a scientific research project and present their findings in a symposium at the end of the program. While CS interns are welcome to participate in any REU activities, it is not required.*

**I see that the potential projects list webapps, do I need to have experience developing web apps?**  
*No, while experience working with web app frameworks (e.g. Python's Flask) is a bonus, it is not a requirement. In my experience, you learn over 80% of what you need on the job. Of course, you need a solid set of programming (and other) skills in order to quickly pick up the specific technologies that we (or any company) use.*

## Other questions?
Please don't hesitate to reach out to Kevin (kguay@bigelow.org) if you have any questions/concerns about the internship or application process. *If you ask a question that others might have, I will post the Q/A in the FAQ section.*
