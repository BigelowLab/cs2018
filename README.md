## Overview
Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences, located in East Boothbay, Maine, seeks a summer intern with a strong background (coursework, experience, etc.) in computer science, interested in applying their skills in a fast-paced research setting.

*\* This is a living document and will be updated with changes and clarifications (both in-line and in the FAQ section).*

## High performance computing lead
Bigelow has a 470 core and ~4TB memory high performance computing cluster. In the past few years, the demand for our HPC has increased and so have our avialable computing resources. This year's intern will:
- improve our use of Ansible for HPC management
- help science staff utilize the HPC
- write custom utilities to help manage the HPC environment
- tweak the PBS pro configuration to fit our needs
- create and maintain HPC documentation

This is a system administraion role that requires software development skills and experience with linux. You can read more about our HPC environment here: https://charlie.bigelow.org/

## Recommended skills/experience
- Scripting language (e.g. bash, R, python)
- Linux (preferably RedHat/CentOS/Fedora)
- Ability to work well independantly

## Other information
The Bigelow summer internship program offers students the opportunity to live in Boothbay and work in a dynamic, cutting-edge research environment. The program runs for 10 weeks from **May 28thâ€”August 2th**.

Interns will be provided with a **stipend** and **housing** (at our new [Residence Hall](https://www.bigelow.org/about/residence-hall.html)).

## How to apply

Please email applications to Kevin Guay, kguay@bigelow.org, with the subject "2020 Internship".

1. **Cover letter** (a brief statement describing why you would be an excellent fit for this internship)
2. **Resume**
3. Link to a **GitHub repo** with a project that you have worked on (if a group project, you must have contributed 40% or more of the code)
	- If you didn't use GitHub for the project, that's okay. Just create a new repository and add the code and instructions to execute.
    - This can be a school project, but should be something that you at least somewhat conceptualized and implemented on your own (e.g. not a step-by-step tutorial project).

## Application process

1. Submit application by Sunday, **March 1**
2. Application review: March 4-6
3. Phone interviews for finalists: March 9-12
4. Final decision emails: by **March 18**

## FAQ
**Can international students with student/work visas apply?**  
*Absolutely!*

**Is this part of the REU program?**  
*No. Durring the summer, Bigelow hosts both [REU](https://www.bigelow.org/education/reu/) students and summer interns. There are activities that are mandatory for REU students, but not for interns. For example, REU students are required to complete a scientific research project and present their findings in a symposium at the end of the program. While CS interns are welcome to participate in any REU activities, it is not required.*

## Other questions?
Please don't hesitate to reach out to Kevin (kguay@bigelow.org) if you have any questions/concerns about the internship or application process. *If you ask a question that others might have, I will post the Q/A in the FAQ section.*
