# Bigelow Computer Science [Remote] Internship 2021

## Applications due February 14, 2021!

## Overview
Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences, located in East Boothbay, Maine, seeks a summer intern with a strong background (coursework, experience, etc.) in computer science, interested in applying their skills in a fast-paced research setting.

*\* This is a living document and will be updated with changes and clarifications (both in-line and in the FAQ section).*

## High performance computing lead
Bigelow has a high performance computing cluster with 470 core and 4TB memory. In the past few years, the demand for our HPC has increased and so have our available computing resources. This year's intern will:
- itterate on existing Ansible scripts for HPC management and write new scripts
- help science staff utilize the HPC
- write custom utilities to help manage the HPC environment
- tweak the PBS pro configuration to fit our needs
- create and maintain HPC documentation

This is a system administration role that requires software development skills and experience with linux. You can read more about our HPC environment here: https://charlie.bigelow.org/

## Recommended skills/experience
- Scripting language (e.g. bash, R, python)
- Linux (preferably RedHat/CentOS/Fedora)
- Ability to work well independently

## Other information
The Bigelow summer internship program offers students the opportunity to work in a dynamic and cutting-edge research environment. The program runs for 10 weeks from **May 24thâ€”July 30th**. The internship will be 100% remote due to COVID.

Interns will be provided with a **stipend**. 

## How to apply

Please email applications to Kevin Guay, kguay@bigelow.org, with the subject "2021 Internship".

1. **Cover letter** (a brief statement describing why you would be an excellent fit for this internship)
2. **Resume**
3. Link to a **GitHub repo** with a project that you have worked on (if a group project, you must have contributed 40% or more of the code)
	- If you didn't use GitHub for the project, that's okay. Just create a new repository and add the code and instructions to run.
    - This can be a school project, but should be something that you at least somewhat conceptualized and implemented on your own (e.g. not a step-by-step tutorial project).

## FAQ
**Can international students with student/work visas apply?**  
*Absolutely*

**Is this part of the REU program?**  
*No. During the summer, Bigelow hosts both [REU](https://www.bigelow.org/education/reu/) students and summer interns. There are activities that are mandatory for REU students, but not for interns. For example, REU students are required to complete a scientific research project and present their findings in a symposium at the end of the program. While CS interns are welcome to participate in any REU activities, it is not required.*

## Other questions?
Please don't hesitate to reach out to Kevin (kguay@bigelow.org) if you have any questions/concerns about the internship or application process. *If you ask a question that others might have, I will post the Q/A in the FAQ section.*
